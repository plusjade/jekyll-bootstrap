## Areas Needing the Most Help

### Adoption

Above all, if nobody knows about Jekyll-bootstrap, nobody is going to benefit from Jekyll-bootstrap,
so please help spread the word.

### Designers

Can you make the Jekyll-bootstrap UI better? Please do!

### Themes

Simple blog themes are needed for Jekyll so people can choose a theme and "drop it in" to their Jekyll site.
This means we need to come up with a standardized method for how to create theme assets.
  
### Javascript

If you are good at javascript we can work together to figure out a definitive client-side plugin strategy for Jekyll.
This is really important because since GitHub pages can't support liquid/jekyll plugins, we can still code robust 
functionality via javascript.
  
### Teaching and Writing  

More content, tutorials information is welcome. You can also proofread existing materials.    

### Include-Helpers

If you are pretty good at hacking Liquid please provide some more include-helpers!
